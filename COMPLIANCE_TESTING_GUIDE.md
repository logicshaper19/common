# Compliance Engine End-to-End Testing Guide

This guide walks you through testing the complete compliance engine with realistic supply chain data from Tier 1 (Brand) all the way down to Tier 5 (Originator/Plantation).

## üéØ Overview

The test scenario creates a complete palm oil supply chain with:
- **5 Companies** across different tiers (Brand ‚Üí Trader ‚Üí Refinery ‚Üí Mill ‚Üí Plantation)
- **4 Purchase Orders** flowing through the supply chain
- **4 Products** representing transformation at each tier
- **Compliance Documents** for EUDR and RSPO regulations
- **Real compliance checks** across the entire chain

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Create Test Scenario

```bash
# From the project root directory
python run_compliance_test.py
```

This creates:
- Companies from Tier 1 to Tier 5
- Users for each company
- Products (FFB ‚Üí CPO ‚Üí RPO ‚Üí Palm Products)
- Purchase orders connecting the supply chain
- Compliance documents
- Runs initial compliance checks

### 2. Test User Accounts Created

| Company | Tier | User | Email | Role |
|---------|------|------|-------|------|
| Global Consumer Brands Inc | 1 | Sarah Johnson | sarah.johnson@globalbrands.com | buyer |
| International Palm Trading Ltd | 2 | Michael Chen | michael.chen@palmtrading.com | buyer |
| Southeast Asia Palm Refinery | 3 | Priya Sharma | priya.sharma@searefinery.com | seller |

## üß© API Testing

### Compliance Endpoints
```bash
# Get compliance overview for a PO
GET /api/v1/compliance/overview/{po_id}

# Evaluate compliance for specific regulation
POST /api/v1/compliance/evaluate/{po_id}?regulation=eudr

# Get compliance dashboard data
GET /api/v1/compliance/dashboard

# Generate compliance report
GET /api/v1/compliance/report/{po_id}
```

### Document Endpoints
```bash
# Upload compliance document
POST /api/v1/documents/upload

# Get documents for PO
GET /api/v1/documents/?po_id={po_id}

# Validate document
POST /api/v1/documents/{doc_id}/validate
```
