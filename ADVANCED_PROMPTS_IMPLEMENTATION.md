Executive Summary:
Your plantation operations are performing at 94.2% transparency compliance, placing you in the top quartile for EUDR readiness. With 450.5 MT across 12 FFB batches, you're well-positioned for the upcoming milling season.

Key Performance Indicators:
‚Ä¢ Inventory Position: 450.5 MT FFB (67% above seasonal average)
‚Ä¢ Compliance Status: 94.2% transparency (industry leading)
‚Ä¢ Operational Efficiency: 8 batches available for immediate processing
‚Ä¢ Supply Chain Risk: Low - diversified mill relationships

Strategic Recommendations:
1. Capitalize on high transparency scores by targeting premium sustainability contracts
2. Optimize harvest timing - current inventory suggests 18-22% OER potential
3. Consider GPS mapping completion for the 3 remaining blocks to achieve 95%+ transparency
