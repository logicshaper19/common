pip install selenium webdriver-manager axe-selenium-python

# Set up test database
python -m app.database.init_db
python -m app.services.seed_data
```

### 2. Execute Testing Suite

```bash
# Run comprehensive tests
python run_final_integration_tests.py --report-file final_report.json

# Run quick tests (API and performance only)
python run_final_integration_tests.py --quick

# Run specific test categories
pytest tests/integration/test_user_journeys.py -v
pytest tests/system/test_comprehensive_system.py -v
pytest tests/validation/test_requirements_validation.py -v
```
