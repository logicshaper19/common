2. **Onboarding Progress Tracking** (`trackers/onboarding_tracker.py`)
   - Update onboarding stages and milestones
   - Calculate conversion rates between stages
   - Track completion times and funnel metrics

3. **Metrics Calculation Engine** (`calculators/metrics_calculator.py`)
   - Calculate viral coefficients and network growth rates
   - Compute cascade and network effect metrics
   - Generate top performer and recent activity data

4. **Cascade Node Management** (`analyzers/cascade_manager.py`)
   - Create and update cascade nodes
   - Calculate node influence scores
   - Manage cascade hierarchies and statistics

5. **Network Analysis** (`analyzers/network_analyzer.py`)

   - Addresses N+1 query problems
   - Provides reusable query patterns

### 📊 **Rich Domain Models**

**Enums with Business Logic:**
- `OnboardingStage`: 8 stages with ordering and completion tracking
- `InvitationStatus`: 5 statuses with active/completed categorization
- `ViralMetricType`: 8 metric types with primary/network groupings
- `CascadeNodeType`: 4 node types with relationship-based determination
- `AnalyticsTimeframe`: 6 timeframes with day conversion utilities
- `ViralChampionTier`: 5 tiers with percentile-based determination

**Data Classes for Type Safety:**
- `CascadeMetrics`: Comprehensive cascade analysis results

- `OnboardingChainVisualization`: Complete chain visualization data
- `NetworkGraphData`: Network graph visualization structures
- `DashboardMetricsData`: Aggregated dashboard metrics

### 🔄 **Backward Compatibility**

The legacy `ViralAnalyticsService` class now acts as a wrapper:
```python
class ViralAnalyticsService:
    def __init__(self, db: Session):
        self._orchestrator = create_viral_analytics_service(db)
    
    def track_supplier_invitation(self, *args, **kwargs):
        return self._orchestrator.track_supplier_invitation(*args, **kwargs)
    
    # ... all other legacy methods delegate to orchestrator
```

**All existing API endpoints and calling code continue to work unchanged.**

## Problems Solved

### ✅ **Single Responsibility Principle**
- **Before**: One class handling 7+ different concerns
- **After**: 7 specialized services, each with a single responsibility
- **Benefit**: Easier to understand, test, and modify individual components

- **After**: Methods distributed across focused services (2-8 methods each)
- **Benefit**: Reduced cognitive load and clearer interfaces

### ✅ **Mixed Abstraction Levels**
- **Before**: High-level business logic mixed with low-level database queries
- **After**: Clear separation between orchestration, business logic, and data access
- **Benefit**: Easier to reason about and maintain different layers

### ✅ **Complex Internal Dependencies**
- **Before**: Intricate method interdependencies within one class
- **After**: Explicit dependency injection between services
- **Benefit**: Clear dependency graph and easier testing

### ✅ **Difficult Testing**
